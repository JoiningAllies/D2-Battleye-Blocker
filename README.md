## The initial purpose of this program is to run along side the Velocity DMA. 

# Simple D2 Battleye Report Remover And In/Out Blocker

- Deletes existing Battleye reports from your system
- Blocks all internet activity In/Out of the Battleye service
- Deletes Bungies miniticketdbg.exe (*yes you can just manually do it but I added it for the lazy people*)
- Provides color coded Report info;
  Green = You're Fine
  Yellow = You had a few Battleye reports. They could have been old
  Red = You should maybe chill tf out buddy


# How To Use

- Place VelocityProtect.exe in your Destiny 2 directory
- Run as Admin
- Leave it open until you are done playing Destiny

__You can also choose to run it again after your session to double check if any reports were made. I'm just too lazy to add a folder watcher__
